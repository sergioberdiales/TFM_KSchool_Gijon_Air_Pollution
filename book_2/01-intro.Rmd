The quality of the air is becoming a source of public concern. 
  - Construct a web dashboard to visualize the evolution of the main air pollution indicators of Gijon city. (Asturias; Spain).
  - Build a model to predict in the short term (<24h) the evolution of air pollutants concentration by monitoring station.

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
